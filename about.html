		<h3 class="aboutList">KITTENS</h3>
		<p class="aboutText">In the adoption world, kittens are usually the first to be adopted and most wanted. With kittens being younger they typically don't have health issues and are perceived as easier to acclimate to a household. Kittens additionally are cheaper at most adoption spots. </p>
		<h3 class="aboutList">OLDER CATS</h3>
		<p class="aboutText"> Older cats are less likely to be adopted due to the higher probability of having existing health issues. Older cats are also seen as already having habits that could be hard to break when bringing them into a new household. They can also cost more compared to the younger cats.
